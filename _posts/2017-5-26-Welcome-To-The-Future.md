Science has brought us this far. And I believe we could have been far more ahead iff they haven't corrupted the mankind from their illogical deities. And here we highbrows has immense feeling of rue to them.. But here we extricate all our grieves to the devil and promise you all to bestow the wisdom to its charm.
