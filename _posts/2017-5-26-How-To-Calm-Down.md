The most obvious way to improve yourself is through controlling yourself. Many a times during a day you will find yourself flown away in feelings and doing things you wouldn't even dream in your conscious state.

We just assume some stuff that is possible and we dig our brains to find all proofs for the specific theories. And that leads to misconceptions. And not little misconceptions like guessing the wrong address but huge and implicative misconceptions that sometimes overturn someone's whole life.
