title: How to control Over-Thinking
author: xypnox

The most obvious way to improve yourself is through controlling yourself. Quite a lot of people prejudge a situation leading to drastic conclusions, both for themselves and for others.  But worry not we are here to train you to stop and reconsider your thoughts. And to help you control jealousy, anger, fear and much more.

## The Root of the Problem: Over-Thinking

Lets be honest; Every single human thinks about future. We all indulge our brain power in thinking about what can happen. Its not bad at all. We are better prepared to deal with something we expect to happen than the unexpected.

> “The unexamined life is not worth living” - Socrates
 

But, like every thing else, thinking should be done in a limit. And exceeding that limit harms more than benefits oneself.

There are huge disadvantages of over-thinking. We form opinions on theories we don't even know to be true. We just assume some stuff that is possible and we dig our brains to find all proofs for those specific theories. And that leads to misconceptions. And not little misconceptions,  like guessing the wrong address, but huge and implicative misconceptions that can overturn anyone's entire life.

## Try _thinking_ less And _doing_ more

But how can we escape the trap of thinking too much. First, try not to jump to conclusions too quickly. Often, people jump to one of the many possible explanations of an event, discarding all the other equally possible or sometimes more probable alternatives.

The second and perhaps the most important thing to prevent thinking nonsense is to test the theories in a subtle way. Any theory that you put as an explanation to an event should lead to observable sub-events. If your explanation explains every single sub-event then it is more likely to be true.


## An idealised example

You have always suspected your neighbor's cat to be a very nasty creature. You have been nurturing disdain for the from the very beginning.

you come home tired from evening walk. And find that some canine creature has excreted in your garden. You are outraged. _You outright assume that this is the act of the neighbor cat_. (**Mistake 1**)

_Then you storm straight at your neighbor's home; neglecting the fact that the excreted material is far more than what a cat can excrete._ (**Mistake 2**) But you assume the neighbor's cat to be a nasty demon and hence a very obese cat.

When you come to the door of your neighbor you see a lock. (Damn!) And you realize that your neighbor has been gone for a holiday a week ago. Then you reason again who might have pooped into your marvelously wonderful garden.

To answer that question it seems, that your cousin rushes out of your house joyous and frivolous. And behind him at his heels is the dog you so happily gifted him two years ago.


### The mistakes

#### Mistake 1

You assumed the culprit to be someone you hate and suspect the most. Its sad to assume already the criminal, for then you will force yourself to bend all the facts against him/her/(cat in this case).

#### Mistake 2

You Bend the obvious contradiction through your disgust for the feline. And that makes you blind to reason further. Your own mind makes you deceive the obvious to the more appropriate.

## Lessons to remember

- Never Judge too Quickly
- Don't prejudge without evidence
- Test your theories, subtly
- Try looking through the perspective of someone else.
- Don't be binary in thoughts
- Don't think with
